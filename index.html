                <h2>St. Louis University High School</h2>
                <p>As a high school student at St. Louis University High School, I got my first job at 13 as a part of the work study program in 2007. My job was to manage the pool hall. During the school year, all I did was take Student IDs and pass out pool balls. The following three years I chose to work over the summers and wax floors with a crew of two other students.

                <h2>Better Family Life</h2>
                <p>The first job I got outside of my high school was working at Better Family Life Inc. in 2011 as a camp counselor. I enjoyed working with the kids there a tremendous amount. They were as young as 5 and as old as 12.  I was responsible for running some of the recreation activities and teaching the kids about computers.

                <h2>The Maroon</h2>
                <p>After graduating high school, I went on to Loyola University in New Orleans, where I was part of the work study program as an Editorial Assistant/Staff Writer at the college paper: The Maroon. This job also served as my first foray into journalism where I learned a lot about how to write a story, interview sources, and take photos for the stories that I was writing.

                <h2>Procter and Gamble</h2>
                <p>In 2014 I took some time off from school and came back to St. Louis where I got a job working in a factory for Procter &  Gamble. The job consisted of putting boxes on pallets and then moving them with an electric pallet jack. The boxes were subsequently moved from the factory floor into the back of the 18 wheeler trucks. THE WORST JOB EVER

                    <h2>AstroCamp</h2>
                    <p>After growing weary of working in a factory, I got a job in Idyllwild, CA at a summer camp where I supervised very wealthy children from the Los Angeles Area. The camp was pretty isolated in the mountains near San Bernardino, CA. It was a great experience because before and between sessions I was able to stay with friends in Los Angeles and San Diego.

                    <h2>Creole Queen</h2>
                    <p>In August of 2014, I returned to New Orleans, where I continued classes at Loyola and got a job aboard a restaurant boat called the Creole Queen. It was a tourist trap. We had people from all over the world consistently eating lunch and dinner. The lunch cruise was a historical tour of New Orleans. The dinner cruise had a live band (with a few students/professors from Loyola). I enjoyed this job a lot because I worked with my classmates and my co-workers were great.

                    <h2>Cardinal Ritter</h2>
                    <p> After I graduated from college, I got a job helping my father as his assistant at Cardinal Ritter College Preparatory High School. This job really helped me to become very malleable and adaptable with what tasks I can perform as I ended up wearing a bunch of different hats in a bunch of different roles (planning a college visit week, making presentations for donors, teaching kids about college admissions, etc.).

                    <p> In 2018 I returned to New Orleans to work for a housing non-profit that was performing one of the most comprehensive policy advocacy efforts for affordable housing in the country. I was fortunate to meet many people
